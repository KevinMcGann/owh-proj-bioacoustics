# OHW Bioacoustics Project
Acoustic data contains information about organisms in the scattering layers. For example, diel vertical migration behavior is visible. The project aims to build tools for classifying and interpreting this data.

## Outcomes
Outcomes are 2 notebooks:
- One first notebook to convert any data into a proper netcdf format ready to use by the rest of the methode
- Second notebook is extracting the layers of interest from the data
